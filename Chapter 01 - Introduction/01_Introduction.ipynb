    "==========\n",
    "__________\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](http://www.python.org) is a very **High Level, object-oriented, dynamic<sup>1</sup>, strong typing<sup>2</sup>, interpreted** & **interactive** programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "```comments\n",
    "1. dynamic: It is a class of high-level programming languages which, at runtime, execute many common programming behaviors that static programming languages perform during compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"strongly typed: because typing errors are prevented at runtime by doing the implicit type conversion, also it do not make use of static type checking, i.e. compiler does not check or enforce type constraint rules. The term **duck typing** is now used to describe the dynamic typing paradigm.\n",
    "In computer programming, duck typing is an application of the duck test in type safety. It requires that type checking be deferred to runtime, and is implemented by means of dynamic typing or reflection.\n",
    "Duck typing is concerned with establishing the suitability of an object for some purpose. With normal typing, suitability is assumed to be determined by an object's type only. In duck typing, an object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties (with appropriate meaning), rather than the actual type of the object.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an open source language (with license compatible with the *General Public License (GPL)*, but less restrictive, allowing Python to be even incorporated into proprietary products). \n",
    "\n",
    "The language specification is maintained by the [Python Software Foundation](http://www.python.org/psf/) (PSF).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "* It uses an elegant syntax, making the code easier to read\n",
    "* easy-to-use language that makes it simple to get code working. This makes it ideal for prototype development and other ad-hoc programming tasks, without compromising maintainability\n",
    "* Default installation contains large standard library which supports most of the common programming tasks, such as connecting to web servers, searching text with regular expressions, reading and modifying files etc\n",
    "* Python's interactive mode, makes it easy to validate snippets of code. \n",
    "* Bundled development environment called IDLE.\n",
    "* Is easily extended by adding new modules implemented in a compiled language such as C or C++.\n",
    "* Can also be embedded into an application to provide a programmable interface.\n",
    "* Runs anywhere, including Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, and Unix.\n",
    "* Is free software in two senses. It doesn't cost anything to download or use Python, or to include it in your application. Python can also be freely modified and re-distributed, because while the language is copyrighted it's available under an open source license. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some programming-language features of Python are:\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "* A variety of basic data types are available: numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimited-length long integers), strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, and dictionaries.\n",
    "* Python supports object-oriented programming with classes and multiple inheritance.\n",
    "* Code can be grouped into modules and packages.\n",
    "* The language supports raising and catching exceptions, resulting in cleaner error handling.\n",
    "* Data types are strongly and dynamically typed. Mixing incompatible types (e.g. attempting to add a string and a number) causes an exception to be raised, so errors are caught sooner.\n",
    "* Python contains advanced programming features such as generators and list comprehensions.\n",
    "* Python's automatic memory management frees you from having to manually allocate and free memory in your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to integrate Python with other languages such as C and Fortran. In general terms, it has many similarities with other dynamic languages such as Perl and Ruby.\n",
    "\n",
    "History\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "The language was created in 1990 by **Guido van Rossum**, at National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands (CWI) and had originally focused on users as physicists and engineers. Python was designed from another existing language at the time, called ABC.\n",
    "![Guido van Rossum](files/GuidoVanRossum.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Versions\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "The official implementation of Python is maintained by the PSF and written in C, and therefore is also known as CPython. The latest stable version is available for download at:\n",
    "\n",
    "[http://www.python.org/download/](http://www.python.org/download/)\n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows platforms, simply run the installer. For other platforms, such as Linux, Python is usually already part of the system, but in some cases it may be necessary to compile and install the interpreter from the source files.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also implementations of Python for. NET (IronPython), JVM (Jython) and Python (PyPy).\n",

    "Dynamic Typing\n",

    "\n",
    "Typing of Python is strong, ie, the interpreter checks whether the transactions are valid and does automatic coercions between incompatible types. In Python, coercions are performed automatically only between types that are clearly related, as integer and long integer. To perform the operation between non-compatible types, you must explicitly convert the type of the variable or variables before the operation."

    "\n",
    "![Compilation, interpretation and packing](files/bpyfd_diags1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the parser compiles the code and stores the bytecode on disk, so the next time you run it, there is no need to recompile the program, reducing the load time of execution. If the source files are changed, the interpreter will be responsible for regenerating the bytecode automatically, even using the *interactive shell*. When a program or a module is invoked, the interpreter performs the analysis of the code, converts to symbols, compiles (if there is no updated bytecode on disk) and runs it in the Python virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bytecode is stored in files with the extension \". pyc\" (normal bytecode) or \". pyo\" (optimized bytecode). The bytecode can also be packaged along with an executable interpreter, to facilitate the distribution of the application, eliminating the need to install Python on each computer."

Pyzo consists of two main components, the editor and the shell, and uses a set of pluggable tools to help the programmer in various ways: e.g. source structure, interactive help, workspace, file browser (with functionality for searching). Also includes a post-mortem debugger.\n",

It was designed to provide a python based environment similiar to Matlab for scientists and engineers however it can also be used as a general purpose interactive python environment especially for interactive GUI programming. Features include: Multiple independent python interpreters. Interactively program with different GUI toolkits (wxPython, [TkInter](/moin/TkInter), pyGTK, pyQT4 and [PySide](/moin/PySide)). Matlab style namespace/workspace browser. Object auto-completions, calltips and multi-line command editing in the console. Object inspection and python path management.
