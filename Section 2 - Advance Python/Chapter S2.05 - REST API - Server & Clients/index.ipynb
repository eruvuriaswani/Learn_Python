    "## What is Cytoscape?\n",
    "[Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/) is an open source software platform for visualizing complex networks and integrating them with any type of attributes. A lot of [Apps](http://apps.cytoscape.org/) are available for various kinds of problem domains, including bioinformatics, social network analysis, and semantic web.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to cyREST\n",
    "[cyREST](http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cyrest) is a Cytoscape App providing access to Cytoscape core data objects including networks, tables, and Styles via RESTful API, which is totally platform/language independent.  This means you can write your own workflows using Cytoscape in programming language of your choice.\n",

    "We assume you have basic knowlege of Cytoscape and Python.  Some of the examples require third party libraries, and you need to know how to setup your own Python environment to satisfy the dependencies.\n",

    "Although cyREST provides a set of language-agnostic API, it requires some _boilarplate code_ to access raw REST API.  To avoid lots of duplicate code, we've released [py2cytoscape](https://github.com/idekerlab/py2cytoscape), a Python wrapper for cyREST.  If you use cyREST with py2cytoscape, you can signisicantly reduce lines of code in your workflow.  Please visit the link below to see how _natural_ the API is for Python users.\n",
