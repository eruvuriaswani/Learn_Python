    "- Allows for compact test suites\n",
    "> The idioms that pytest first introduced brought a change in the Python community because they made it possible for test suites to be written in a very compact style, or at least far more compact than was ever possible before.\n",
    "> Pytest basically introduced the concept that Python tests should be plain Python functions instead of forcing developers to include their tests inside large test classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Minimal boilerplate\n",
    "> Tests written with pytest need very little boilerplate code, which makes them easy to write and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tests parametrization\n",
    "> You can parametrize any test and cover all uses of a unit without code duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very pretty and useful failure information\n",
    "> Pytest rewrites your test so that it can store all intermediate values that can lead to failing assert and provides you with very pretty explanation about what has been asserted and what have failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fixtures are simple and easy to use\n",
    "> A fixture is just a function that returns a value and to use a fixture you just have to add an argument to your test function. You can also use a fixture from another fixture in the same manner, so it's easy to make them modular.\n",
    "You can also parametrize fixture and every test that uses it will run with all values of parameters, no test rewrite needed. If your test uses several fixtures, all parameters' combinations will be covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pdb just works\n",
    "> Pytest `**automagically**` (and safely) disables output capturing when you're entering pdb, so you don't have to redirect debugger to other console or bear huge amount of unneeded output from other tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test discovery by file-path\n",
    "\n",
    "- Over 150 plugins \n",
    "> more than 150 plugins to customise py.test such as pytest-BDD and pytest-konira for writing tests for Behaviour Driven Testing"

In other words, writing tests for pytest means that you are tying yourself to only pytest and the only way to use another testing framework is to rewrite most of the code."
