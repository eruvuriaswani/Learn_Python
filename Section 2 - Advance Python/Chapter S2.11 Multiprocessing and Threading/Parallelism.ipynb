   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Running a computation in multiple processes requires some communication between these processes. One of the nice aspects of multiprocessing in Python is that most of the time you do not need to know how this communication is handled: it just works. However, it is useful to understand the basics of this mechanism in order to figure out how to solve two kinds of problems: unexpected errors, and bad performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication between processes takes the form of streams of bytes that travel through specific communication channels. To send an object from one process to another, Python has to convert it to a stream of bytes, and assemble the object back at the receiving end. Python's mechanism for doing these conversions was originally designed for storing objects in files and is implemented in the pickle module. Every argument that is passed to a Python function running in another process is pickled and then unpickled. The result of the function undergoes the same process on its way back.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two things you need to know about pickle in the context of multiprocessing. First, most objects can be pickled but some cannot. Second, pickling and unpickling take time and can sometimes add considerable overhead to your multiprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objects that cannot be pickled come in two varieties: those for which pickling does not make sense, and those for which it has simply not been implemented. A good example for the first category is file objects. The second category contains mainly object types defined in extension modules whose authors didn't implement pickling. If you use an old release of NumPy, you may discover that its array-aware functions are not picklable, making it impossible to use such a function directly as a task in multiprocessing. For Python's built-in objects, there is one important restriction that is due to the implementation details of pickle: functions and classes can only be pickled if they are defined at the top level of a module. This means, for example, that if you define a function inside another function, you cannot pickle it and thus not pass it to a multiprocessing task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance implications of pickling are rather obvious: you should try to pass as few arguments as possible to your tasks, and make sure you pass no more data than you really need to. For example, rather than passing a huge list and the index of the item that your taks is supposed to process, you should pass only that item."
