    "- **Supervised Learning** in which the data comes with additional attributes that we want to predict. This problem can be either:\n",
    "    * _**Classification**_ - The action or process of classifying something. `Classification` means to group the output into a class.\n",
    "    * _**Regression**_ - a measure of the relation between the mean value of one variable (e.g. output) and corresponding values of other variables (e.g. time and cost). It is defined as E[Y | X] (the expectation of Y given X). A subset of these types of models where Y is binary or categorical (including logistic regression and multinomial regression along with many machine learning algorithms that essential have the same target [such as classification trees]) are useful for classification.\n",
    "- **Unsupervised Learning** in which the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values. The goal in such problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called clustering, or to determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as density estimation, or to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization (Click here to go to the Scikit-Learn unsupervised learning page).\n",
    "- **Semi-supervised learning** in which combines both labeled and unlabeled example to generate an appropriate function or classifier.\n",
    "- **Reinforcement Learning**\n",
    "- **Association Learning**\n",
    "- **Transduction** is similar to supervised learning, but does not explicitly construct a function: instead, tries to predict new outputs based on training inputs, training outputs, and new inputs.\n",
    "- **Learning to learn** is where the algorithm learns its own inductive bias based on previous experience. "
